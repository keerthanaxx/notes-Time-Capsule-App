## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

Time Capsule is built using a single `index.html` file that leverages a combination of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. It does not require a server or a backend, making it incredibly lightweight and easy to use.

-   **HTML:** Structures the application's layout, from the sidebar and top bar to the various content sections (dashboard, notes, calendar, etc.).
-   **CSS:** The styling is inspired by a "Cherry Blossom Theme" with a dark background (`--bg: #1a0f1b;`), a muted text color (`--text: #ffe9f6;`), and an accent color of blossom pink (`--accent: #ff80ab;`). It uses a modern, clean grid-based layout for responsiveness.
-   **JavaScript:** The core logic of the application. It handles all user interactions, including:
    -   **Data Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to save and retrieve user data, including tasks, notes, and checklist items.
    -   **Dynamic Rendering:** Populates the UI elements (e.g., task lists, calendar days, timeline items) based on the data stored.
    -   **State Management:** Manages which section of the app is currently visible.
    -   **Charts:** Uses the popular **Chart.js** library to create beautiful and informative data visualizations.
    -   **Web Speech API:** Implements the voice-to-text functionality to transcribe spoken words into text inputs.

## üé® Design & Theme

The design philosophy is centered around a calming and aesthetically pleasing user experience. The color palette is carefully chosen to create a serene and focused environment.

-   `--bg`: A deep purple-black for the background.
-   `--accent`: A vibrant "blossom pink" for highlights and key elements.
-   `--card`: A subtle, transparent white for card backgrounds, giving the interface a modern, frosted glass effect.

The use of an elegant `Inter` font and minimalist icons keeps the interface clean and easy to navigate.
